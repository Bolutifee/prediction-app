                <h2>Causes & Prevention</h2>
                <p>
                    The causes of breast cancer are not fully understood, but certain risk factors have been identified. 
                    These include age, gender (being a woman), family history, genetic mutations (such as BRCA1 and BRCA2), 
                    hormonal factors, previous breast cancer history, and lifestyle factors (such as alcohol consumption, lack 
                    of physical activity, and obesity). Prevention strategies for breast cancer focus on reducing risk factors 
                    and promoting early detection. Regular screening, including mammograms and clinical breast exams, helps with 
                    early diagnosis and treatment. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle, such as engaging in regular exercise, maintaining 
                    a balanced diet, limiting alcohol intake, avoiding tobacco use, and managing weight, can contribute to reducing the 
                    risk. For individuals at higher risk, preventive measures such as medications or prophylactic surgery may be considered.

                <h2>Symptoms</h2>
                <p>
                    Breast cancer can present with various symptoms, although some early-stage cases may not 
                    cause noticeable signs. Common symptoms include the presence of a breast lump or thickening 
                    that feels different from the surrounding tissue. Changes in the size, shape, or appearance 
                    of the breast, such as dimpling, puckering, or redness of the skin, may occur. Nipple changes, 
                    including inversion, discharge (other than breast milk), or scaling and crusting, can also be 
                    warning signs. Persistent breast or nipple pain, swelling in the armpit or around the collarbone, 
                    and enlargement of the lymph nodes are possible symptoms. It's important to note that while these 
                    symptoms may indicate breast cancer, they can also be caused by other conditions. If any of these 
                    symptoms persist or cause concern, it is advisable to seek medical evaluation for accurate diagnosis 
                    and timely intervention.

                <h2>Treatment</h2>
                <p>
                    The treatment of breast cancer depends on several factors, including the stage of the cancer, the 
                    presence of specific receptors, and the patient's overall health. Common treatment options include 
                    surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and hormone therapy. Surgery is often 
                    the primary treatment and involves removing the tumor and surrounding tissue. This may include 
                    lumpectomy (removal of the tumor and a small margin of healthy tissue) or mastectomy (removal of the entire breast). 
                    Radiation therapy uses high-energy X-rays or other radiation sources to destroy cancer cells or shrink tumors. 
                    Chemotherapy utilizes drugs to kill cancer cells throughout the body, often administered intravenously. 
                    Targeted therapy focuses on specific molecular characteristics of cancer cells and uses drugs to block their 
                    growth and spread. Hormone therapy is used when breast cancer cells have receptors for estrogen or progesterone 
                    and aims to reduce hormone levels or block their effects. The treatment plan is individualized based on the specific 
                    characteristics of the cancer and the patient's preferences and may involve a combination of these treatment modalities.
