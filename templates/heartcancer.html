                <p>
                    Heart cancer is an extremely rare condition. Malignant tumors originating in the heart are uncommon, 
                    and most tumors found in the heart are noncancerous. As a result, the understanding of the specific 
                    causes and prevention of heart cancer is limited. The exact causes of heart cancer are not well-defined. 
                    However, certain risk factors may contribute to its development, such as prior radiation therapy to the 
                    chest, certain genetic conditions, and exposure to certain chemicals or toxins. It's important to note that 
                    most heart tumors are noncancerous and may not have identifiable causes. Given the rarity of heart cancer, 
                    there are no specific prevention strategies available. However, maintaining a healthy lifestyle, including 
                    regular exercise, a balanced diet, avoiding smoking and excessive alcohol consumption, and managing chronic 
                    conditions, may contribute to overall heart health.

                <h2>Symptoms</h2>
                <p>
                    Heart cancer is an extremely rare condition, and symptoms specifically related to heart cancer 
                    are not well-documented due to its rarity. Malignant tumors originating in the heart are uncommon, 
                    with most tumors in the heart being noncancerous. In cases of primary cardiac tumors, symptoms can 
                    vary depending on the tumor's size, location, and extent. Possible symptoms may include chest pain, 
                    irregular heartbeats, shortness of breath, fatigue, swelling in the legs or abdomen, and fainting 
                    episodes. However, it's important to note that these symptoms can also be associated with other heart 
                    conditions or general health issues. If you experience any concerning symptoms related to the heart or 
                    have heart-related concerns, it is crucial to seek medical evaluation from a healthcare professional 
                    specialized in cardiac conditions for accurate diagnosis and appropriate management.

                <h2>Treatment</h2>
                <p>
                    The treatment for heart cancer typically involves surgical removal of the tumor. The specific surgical approach 
                    depends on factors such as the tumor's size, location, and extent. In some cases, additional treatments like radiation 
                    therapy or chemotherapy may be considered, particularly if the tumor is malignant or has spread to other areas of the body. 
                    Surgery aims to completely remove the tumor while preserving heart function. If the tumor is benign, surgical excision alone 
                    may be curative. However, if the tumor is malignant or has metastasized, additional treatments may be necessary to target any 
                    remaining cancer cells. It's important to note that the treatment plan for heart cancer is highly individualized, and decisions 
                    are made in consultation with a multidisciplinary team of experts. Seeking guidance from healthcare professionals specializing 
                    in cardiac conditions and oncology is crucial to determine the most appropriate treatment options for each patient.
