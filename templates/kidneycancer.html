                <h2>Causes & Prevention</h2>
                <p>
                    Kidney cancer can be caused by various factors, including genetic conditions, environmental exposures, 
                    and lifestyle choices. Inherited genetic conditions like von Hippel-Lindau disease and Birt-Hogg-Dub√© 
                    syndrome increase the risk. Smoking, obesity, and high blood pressure are also significant risk factors. 
                    Exposure to certain chemicals can further contribute to the development of kidney cancer. Prevention measures 
                    include quitting smoking, maintaining a healthy weight through balanced diet and exercise, managing blood pressure, 
                    staying hydrated, and being cautious of occupational hazards. Regular check-ups, screenings, and adopting a healthy 
                    lifestyle can help reduce the risk. It's advised to consult healthcare professionals for personalized guidance 
                    based on individual risk factors and medical history.

                <h2>Symptoms</h2>
                <p>
                    As kidney cancer progresses, symptoms may manifest, although early stages can be asymptomatic. Common signs 
                    include hematuria (blood in urine), persistent lower back pain, palpable masses or lumps in the side or abdomen, 
                    fatigue, unexplained weight loss, loss of appetite, and occasionally fever and night sweats. It's important to 
                    note that these symptoms are not exclusive to kidney cancer and can be caused by other conditions. If you experience 
                    persistent or concerning symptoms, it's advisable to seek medical attention for proper evaluation and diagnosis. 
                    Early detection plays a crucial role in improving treatment outcomes for kidney cancer, so it's essential to be vigilant 
                    and consult a healthcare professional for further assessment.

                <h2>Treatment</h2>
                <p>
                    Treatment options for kidney cancer depend on factors such as the cancer stage, patient's overall health, 
                    and preferences. Surgery is the primary approach, involving radical nephrectomy (removal of the entire kidney) 
                    or partial nephrectomy (removal of the tumor and part of the kidney). Minimally invasive techniques may be 
                    employed. Additional treatments include targeted therapy, using medications to block cancer cell growth, and 
                    immunotherapy, which stimulates the immune system to attack cancer cells. Radiation therapy may be used in 
                    specific cases, and systemic therapy (chemotherapy or hormone therapy) is considered for advanced or metastatic 
                    kidney cancer. Treatment decisions are individualized, with a multidisciplinary team of healthcare professionals 
                    tailoring plans based on the patient's unique circumstances. The team, including surgeons and oncologists, 
                    discusses available options and develops a personalized treatment approach. It's important to consult with 
                    healthcare professionals for accurate guidance based on individual needs.
