                <h2>Causes & Prevention</h2>
                <p>
                    Lung cancer has several causes, with the primary one being tobacco smoke, responsible for the majority of cases. Exposure to secondhand smoke, occupational hazards such as asbestos and radon, environmental pollutants, and genetic factors also contribute to the risk. Preventing lung cancer involves comprehensive efforts. This includes avoiding or quitting smoking and minimizing exposure to secondhand smoke. Creating smoke-free environments, implementing stricter tobacco regulations, and raising public awareness are crucial steps. Reducing exposure to occupational carcinogens, improving indoor and outdoor air quality, and implementing effective screening programs for early detection can further aid prevention. Leading a healthy lifestyle, including regular exercise, a balanced diet rich in fruits and vegetables, and minimizing exposure to environmental pollutants, can also play a significant role in reducing the risk of lung cancer.

                <h2>Symptoms</h2>
                <p>
                    Lung cancer can present with a range of symptoms that can vary depending on the stage and 
                    location of the tumor. Common symptoms include a persistent cough that worsens over time, 
                    coughing up blood or rust-colored sputum, chest pain that intensifies with deep breathing or 
                    coughing, hoarseness, unexplained weight loss, fatigue, and recurring respiratory infections 
                    such as bronchitis or pneumonia. Shortness of breath, wheezing, loss of appetite, and swelling 
                    in the neck or face can also occur. It's important to note that these symptoms can be caused by 
                    other conditions, but if any of these persist or cause concern, it's advisable to seek medical 
                    evaluation for accurate diagnosis. A healthcare professional may conduct various diagnostic tests, 
                    including imaging scans and biopsies, to determine the presence of lung cancer. Early detection 
                    of lung cancer is crucial for better treatment outcomes. Therefore, if you experience any of these 
                    symptoms or have risk factors such as smoking history or exposure to lung cancer-causing substances, 
                    it's important to discuss your concerns with a healthcare provider.

                <h2>Treatment</h2>
                <p>
                    The treatment of lung cancer involves various approaches based on cancer type, stage, and overall 
                    health. Common treatments include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, 
                    immunotherapy, and clinical trials. Surgery is recommended for early-stage lung cancer, removing 
                    the tumor and affected tissue. Radiation therapy uses high-energy radiation to destroy cancer cells 
                    or shrink tumors. Chemotherapy administers drugs to kill cancer cells throughout the body. Targeted 
                    therapy targets genetic mutations or proteins in cancer cells. Immunotherapy boosts the immune system 
                    to recognize and attack cancer cells. Clinical trials offer access to new treatments and advancements. 
                    A multidisciplinary approach, involving a team of specialists, develops individualized treatment plans. 
                    Decisions consider cancer characteristics and patient health. Regular monitoring and follow-up care are 
                    essential for ongoing management. Consulting healthcare professionals is crucial to determine suitable 
                    treatment options for each case.
